# Covid-19-risk-prediction

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that, given a Covid-19 patient's current symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is in high risk or not. To this end, we will use several classification techniques in machine learning.

1. K-Nearest Neighbours
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Trees
4. Multilayer Perceptron

In each technique we will test a variety of hyperparameters values to get the best model.
